## About The Project
![Ekran görüntüsü 2023-06-04 223706](https://github.com/dilarauluturhan/submenus/assets/120499369/eb2cfa89-9753-4f5a-b311-0c222fa26f70)

## Features
I implemented state management using React Hooks. I focused on providing a dynamic experience using popular React Hooks like useState and useEffect. I managed the necessary states using useState to facilitate opening and closing submenus. Using useRef and useEffect, I tracked user interactions and had submenus automatically closed when needed.

## Design
In this project, I used Pure CSS for the design.

## Built With
I created this project using the React.js and React Icons.
